📊 COVID-19 Vaccination Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository contains an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualizing state-wise COVID-19 vaccination data across India. The dashboard includes insights on total doses administered, individuals registered/vaccinated, gender-based distribution, and vaccine types (Covishield and Covaxin).

The goal of this project is to present COVID-19 vaccination data in a clean, dynamic, and interactive format using Power BI. This enables users to:

Monitor vaccination progress by state

Analyze gender-based vaccination distribution (Male, Female, Transgender)

Compare registration vs actual vaccination rates

View data for specific states through filtering and maps

Understand vaccine usage (Covishield vs Covaxin)

📌 Key Features

🗺️ State-wise Geographic Visualization

📈 Tree Map & Bar Charts for quick visual comparison

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Gender Distribution Analysis

💉 Dose Administration Breakdown

🧮 Registration vs Vaccination Donut Chart

📍 Total Active Vaccination Sites (e.g., 181K)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop

Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning)

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Data Source: Public COVID-19 API / Government datasets (as applicable)

🧠 Insights Derived
Over 138M people registered; 148M vaccinated (~52% coverage)

Male-to-female vaccination ratio is close, but slightly higher for females

Covishield dominates in total administered doses

State-wise disparities can be quickly identified using the map and filters
